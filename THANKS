The THANKS file:

All distributions should contain a `THANKS' file containing a two column list
of the contributors, one per line, alphabetically sorted. The left column gives
the contributor's name, while the right column gives the last known good email
address for this contributor. This list should be introduced with a wording
similar to this one:

 MaNGOS THANKS file

 MaNGOS has originally been written by Team Python and WoW Daemon Team. Many
 people further contributed to MaNGOS by reporting problems, suggesting various
 improvements or submitting actual code.

 Here is a list of these people. Help me keep it complete and exempt of errors.

 Special thanks should also go out to the WowwoW team. We have gained help from
 them many times in the creation of this project. Keep up the good work guys.

 Thanks should also go out to the Ludmilla team, who are also providing the
 community with a great server. We have not gained too much help from them,
 but we have recieved some.

The easiest policy with this file is to thank everyone who contributes to the
project, without judging the value of the contribution.

Unlike `AUTHORS', the `THANKS' file is not maintained for legal reasons. It is
maintained to thank all the contributors that helped you out in your project.
The `AUTHORS' file can not be used for this purpose because certain
contributions, like bug reports or ideas and suggestions do not require legal
paper exchanges.

You can also decide to send some kind of special greeting when you initially
add a name to your `THANKS' file. The mere presense of a name in `THANKS' is
then a flag to you that the initial greeting has been sent.
