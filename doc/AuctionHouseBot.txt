Auction Houses Bot populates the auction houses with items.
It makes the game feel a bit more active in auction usage part
specially for low-populated servers. Items and prices are chosen
randomly based on the parameters you define. If an auction expires, auctions
are deleted quietly. AHBot will not buy it's own items, and will not receive
mail from the AH or get returned mail.
